# ProbeCalibration
Initial task for 3D identification of 2D ultrasound images performed with a motion capture system 

Performed with open source package Py3DFreeHandUS (https://github.com/u0078867/Py3DFreeHandUS)

This is a record of my use of the package and which parts are useful for my research.
